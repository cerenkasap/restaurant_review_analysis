## Data Cleaning

After pulling the data, I cleaned up the dataset to reduce noises in the dataset. The changes were made follows:

* Made lowercase the sentences, removed punctuations in the sentences, tokenized words, removed stop words from the sentences and lemmatized them.



## Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized the cleaned data to see the trends.

* Created *WordCloud* for **Reviews**.

* Created *Donut chart* for **Review** data.

It looks like our data is balanced.

* Created *2-Gram Analysis Bar Graphs* for **Review** variables.

* Created a histogram for **Polarity Score** in Sentences
![alt text](https://github.com/cerenkasap/restaurant_review_analysis/blob/master/images/polarity_score.png "Polarity Score in Sentences")
Sentences with *negative* polarity will be in range of [-1, 0), *neutral* ones will be 0.0, and *positive* reviews will have the range of (0, 1).

* Created a histogram for **Length of Sentences** 
![alt text](https://github.com/cerenkasap/restaurant_review_analysis/blob/master/images/length_of_reviews.png "Length of Reviews")
Based on this histogram, we know that our review has text length between approximately 20-80 characters.

* Created a histogram for **Word Counts** in Sentences
![alt text](https://github.com/cerenkasap/restaurant_review_analysis/blob/master/images/word_counts.png "Word Counts in Reviews")
From the figure above, we infer that most of the reviews consist of 1 word to 10 words.
